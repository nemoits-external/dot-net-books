Sure! Here is a simpler assignment that can be completed within two days, focusing on key aspects of .NET development, including web development with ASP.NET Core, basic database integration, and API creation.

### Assignment: Book Management System

**Description:**
Create a simple Book Management System that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

**Requirements:**

1. **ASP.NET Core Web Application:**
   - Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project.
   - Scaffold a basic MVC structure (Models, Views, Controllers).

2. **Book Model:**
   - Create a `Book` model with the following properties:
     - `Id` (int)
     - `Title` (string)
     - `Author` (string)
     - `PublicationDate` (DateTime)
     - `ISBN` (string)
     - `Genre` (string)

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Use Entity Framework Core with a SQLite database.
   - Set up the database context and connection string.
   - Create a migration and update the database to include a `Books` table.

4. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implement the following actions in the BooksController:
     - `Index` (list all books)
     - `Create` (add a new book)
     - `Edit` (update an existing book)
     - `Delete` (remove a book)
     - `Details` (view details of a specific book)

5. **Views:**
   - Create Razor views for each action (Index, Create, Edit, Delete, Details).
   - Use simple forms for Create and Edit views.
   - Use Bootstrap for basic styling.

6. **Validation:**
   - Add server-side validation for the `Book` model using Data Annotations.
   - Ensure that all required fields are filled and that the `ISBN` follows a proper format.

7. **Testing:**
   - Write a few basic unit tests for the `BooksController` to test CRUD operations.
   - Ensure tests cover creating, updating, and deleting books.

### Bonus (Optional):

1. **API Endpoint:**
   - Create a simple API endpoint to get the list of books in JSON format.
   - Implement an endpoint `/api/books` that returns all books.

2. **Authentication (Optional):**
   - Add basic authentication to secure the create, update, and delete actions.
   - Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user management.

### Assessment Criteria:

- **Code Quality:** Ensure the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- **Functionality:** Verify that all CRUD operations work correctly.
- **Database Integration:** Check proper use of Entity Framework Core for database operations.
- **Validation:** Ensure server-side validation is correctly implemented.
- **Testing:** Review the unit tests to ensure they adequately cover the functionality.
- **User Interface:** Assess the simplicity and usability of the UI, including form handling and display of data.

This assignment should provide a good challenge for a mid-level .NET developer while being manageable within a two-day timeframe.
